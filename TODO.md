# Computer set up: TODO

## Linux only
* A window manager 

## Mac only

## Tmux

## Vim
### Remaps
* [ ] screen splitting 
* [ ] moving between split screens 
* [ ] opening fuzzy finder 
* [ ] copying to clipboard between different windows and when coming from outside of vim is a shitshow right now
* [ ] the fucking folds - i want them closed by default, and i want them to stay closed when i scroll through them and closed when i scroll out of them (the latter is debateable)

## Zsh - (currently using ohmyzsh)
